Each Model has a set of steps that need to run for different use cases and in different environments.
Use cases per model are related to the user profile, for example a model may expose the following use cases:
- A README showing how the model can be run
- A Notebook walking the user through the steps to download a dataset, preprocess the data and then run the model
- A script or scripts that the user runs on bare-metal to train a model or run inference on a model
- A script or scripts that the user runs in docker to train a model or run inference on a model
- A deployment yaml that the user deploys to kubernetes using kubectl

The steps per use case may vary as a function of the use case. 
For example, running the model on bare-metal may involve something like:
1. apt install (Kustomize function)
2. virtualenv create
3. pip install requirements.txt
4. Download dataset 
5. Convert to TFRecord
6. Run Training

Similary, running the model in docker may involve something like:
1. Download a docker image specifically built for the model
2. Run the docker image that does similar steps as the bare-metal use case above.

Design 
1. Should be a type of generator, where different environments are generated that include the steps per model.
   We don't want to expose the datascientist to complicated tooling.
   We want each scenario (usecase) to be as simple as possible.
   foreach model
     foreach environment
       foreach step
2. Declarative / template free 


Candidate frameworks:
1. GoCD (https://www.gocd.org/)
2. Kustomize (https://kustomize.io/)


Thoughts on implementation of steps:
- Steps almost need to be an api - where different environments may implement each step differently
- Steps could be a DAG rather than a pipeline
- Can steps be kustomize functions 


Thoughts on implementation of environments:
- Each environment needs to implement steps for each model. 
  Each model has variants (fp32, bfloat16, training, inference) 
- Can each environment be a kustomize overlay?
